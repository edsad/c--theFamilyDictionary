Define a Dictionary that contains information about several members of your family. Use the following example as a template.

Dictionary<string, Dictionary<string, string>> myFamily = new Dictionary<string, Dictionary<string, string>>();

myFamily.Add("sister", new Dictionary<string, string>(){ 
    {"name", "Krista"},
    {"age", "42"}
});
Next, iterate over each item in myFamily and produce the following output.

Krista is my sister and is 42 years old
